# Roomventory

### The collective inventory for you and your roommates

* Know what you have
* Know what you need
* Never buy too much toilet paper again

Never deal with four people all buying toilet paper and no one buying what you actually need (like forks).

Roomventory is a FREE group-based inventory tracker for you and your friends to track your inventory.

### Main Features:
* Multiple groups: have multiple group inventories with different people
* Inventory collections: manage your inventory by organizing items in different collections (toilet paper goes in the bathroom, not the kitchen)
* Item tags: know who bought what, so you know who to blame when something runs out

### Credits
This is a software project built by @awnder, @rafiks07, and @connerng for [Headstarter](https://headstarter.co/), built to solve a problem that they faced in their lives. 
Roomventory is powered by NextJS and MaterialUI, with Firestore and Clerk.
